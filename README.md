## Running the project

In the project directory, navigate to **client** and download all necessary packages:

```
cd client
npm start
```

Then, run the client by typing:

```
npm start
```

In a separate terminal, navigate to the **backend** folder in the project directory and run the server:

```
cd backend
python server.py
```

Open the application at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Changes should update as you save your files.
